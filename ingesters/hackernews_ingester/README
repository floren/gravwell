# Hacker News Ingester

This is a simple ingester to grab Hacker News comments. We just run it from the command line instead of bothering with services and daemons.

Get it:

	go get github.com/gravwell/gravwell/ingesters/hackernews_ingester

Run it with Gravwell on the local machine:

	hackernews_ingester -pipe-conn /opt/gravwell/comms/pipe -ingest-secret <secret>

With Gravwell on a different machine:

	hackernews_ingester -clear-conn <gravwell ip>:4023 -ingest-secret <secret>

The comments are ingested with the tag "hackernews" by default. Here's a simple serach to see which articles are getting the most comments: 

	tag=hackernews json "article-title" as title | count by title | table title count
